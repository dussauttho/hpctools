## Task 2

I coded with c++11, so you need an up-to-date g++ compilor and the tag "-std=c++11" to specify the correct C++ version

I used a friend's computer to work (Thibault Le Quéré), that's why all the commits are under his name, I didn't found how to solve this problem.

## Task 3

Because the Intel tools not being availale with the C++11 standard, I used Sasha Ondarts' task 2 C source code in order to do the task 3
